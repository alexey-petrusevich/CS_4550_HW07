Web Dev Spring 2021 HW07 Status

Answer the following questions:


1. What's your name?
Alexey Petrusevich


2. What's the URL of the github repo with your work for this HW?
https://github.com/alexey-petrusevich/CS_4550_HW07


3. What's the URL that you deployed to?
http://events.quickjohnny.art/


4. Is your app functionality complete? If not, what's missing?
Everything except for bootstrap datepicker - a "native" date time picker is used instead.


5. Is your app properly deployed? If not, what went wrong?
Properly deployed


6. If you would like the deployment for an old homework to be reconsidered, what
are the links to your Inkfish submission and deployed site?
Inkfish Submission --> https://inkfish.ntuck-neu.site/grades/6315
Deployed Site --> http://hw03.quickjohnny.art/
I lost points on incorrect mention of the host URL. Other homework require change of source code.

And here's a list of tasks for grading comments. Just leave this here:
 - Development
 - Deployment
 - Submission
